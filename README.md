# Simple File Transfer Protocol (FTP) in C for Linux

This project was developed as part of university coursework and is a collaborative effort between **Terence Lee Xin Jin** and **Hendra Kurniawan**.

## Authors
- Terence Lee Xin Jin
- Hendra Kurniawan

## Overview
This project implements a basic File Transfer Protocol (FTP) in C (GNU) for Linux using **low-level system programming concepts**. It facilitates file transfers between a client and a server over a network connection through direct interaction with the Linux operating system.

## Features
- **Send and receive files** ‚Äì Transfer files between client and server.
- **Text-based command interface** ‚Äì Use simple commands to initiate file transfers.
- **Linux-based** ‚Äì Designed for GNU/Linux environments using C.
- **Daemon mode** ‚Äì Server runs in the background as a daemon.
- **Logging** ‚Äì Server logs all interactions to a log file.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Programming Concepts Used

This project demonstrates key concepts in system-level programming on Unix-like systems:

- **POSIX System Calls** ‚Äì Uses `fork()`, `exec()`, `waitpid()`, `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, `close()`, and `chdir()` for process and file management.
- **Socket Programming** ‚Äì Implements TCP-based communication using `socket()`, `bind()`, `listen()`, `accept()`, and `connect()`.
- **Daemon Processes** ‚Äì Server runs as a background daemon, demonstrating inter-process communication and service management.
- **File System Interaction** ‚Äì Allows dynamic file listing, navigation, and transfers using direct file system access.
- **Process Control** ‚Äì Demonstrates client-server architecture and concurrent handling through multiple processes.

This reflects a practical application of Linux system programming concepts typically covered in operating systems or systems programming coursework.

## üìÑ Documentation
[File-Transfer-Protocol-Documentation.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20023767/File-Transfer-Protocol-Documentation.pdf)

## Prerequisites
- Linux-based operating system
- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)

## Getting Started

### Running the Server

```bash
cd Server
make
sudo ./myftpd [initial_current_directory]
```

- The server program is named `myftpd`, where the `d` stands for **daemon**.
- It runs as a background daemon process.
- Optionally, you can provide an initial current directory. If omitted, it inherits the directory from the parent process.
- If supplied, the server sets the directory using the `chdir()` function.
- The server maintains its own current working directory which clients can change using the `cd` command.

### Running the Client

```bash
cd Client
make
sudo ./myftp [hostname | IP_address]
```

- The client program is named `myftp`.
- If a hostname or IP address is not specified, it connects to the **localhost** by default.

## Usage

Once the connection between the client and server is established, the client will display a prompt (`$`), and users can enter the following commands:

| Command                  | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| `pwd`                    | Display the **server's** current working directory. |
| `lpwd`                   | Display the **client's** current working directory. |
| `dir`                    | List files in the **server's** current directory. |
| `ldir`                   | List files in the **client's** current directory. |
| `cd directory_pathname`  | Change the **server's** current directory. Supports `.` and `..` |
| `lcd directory_pathname` | Change the **client's** current directory. Supports `.` and `..` |
| `get filename`           | Download a file from the **server** to the **client**. |
| `put filename`           | Upload a file from the **client** to the **server**. |
| `quit`                   | Terminate the FTP session. |

## Notes
- This is an academic project and **not intended for production use**.
- Start the server **before** running the client.
- All communication occurs over a specified TCP port.
- Use in a **safe, local environment** ‚Äî encryption and user authentication are **not implemented**.
